;company mints them, and then sends them to an address that we control (or they get minted directly into that address, don't think that makes a difference)
;the company (not governance) would have the right to melt any unvested tokens if one of us leaves
;so we'd need some sort of spend path in the puzzle that's locking up those coins that allows the company to do that
;
;pretty indifferent re vesting intervals. monthly is pretty standard, but if a step function is a hassle to implement we can also do daily or even by the second if that simplifies the timestamp maths
;yes, vesting schedule would have to be part of it

; TODO: implement a lockup puzzle to lockup coins for a certain amount of time
