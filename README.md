# Circuit Puzzles

Circuit puzzles are what make the Circuit protocol tick. They are the building blocks of the protocol and are used to create the stablecoin, Bytecash (BYC).

This is a python package that includes all puzzles needed to run Circuit protocol. 

## Installation 

```bash
pip install circuit_puzzles
```
## Status 

Most puzzles are in a feature complete stage, but not optimized yet. They should be safe though, so feel free to 
review from a security perspective.

Auction puzzles are still under heavy development and are not ready for review.
