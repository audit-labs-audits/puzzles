# Circuit Puzzles

Circuit puzzles are what make the Circuit protocol tick. They are the building blocks of the protocol and are used to create the stablecoin, Bytecash (BYC).

This is a python package that includes all puzzles needed to run Circuit protocol. 


## Project Status

The majority of the puzzles are currently in a _feature complete_ stage.
They are functional but have not been optimized or audited yet.
These puzzles are currently in operation on [circuitdao.com](https://circuitdao.com)
and are undergoing testing on the testnet.

Please note that the **auction puzzles** are still under active development and are not ready for review.
